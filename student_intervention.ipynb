    "          - Easy to understand.\n",
    "          - Requires little data preparation compared to other algorithms which often require data normalization.\n",
    "          - Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "          - The data points are recursively split to form the tree, therefore the prediction time is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "      - Cons\n",
    "          - Decision trees can easily overfit if the trees are over-complex.\n",
    "          - Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated.\n",
    "          - It is hard for Decision trees to learn some concepts i.e. XOR, parity.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one.

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "We first look at the metric score. We use F1 score to measure the algorithm performance. Decision Tree Classifier achieved perfect F1 score on training dataset while it performed poorly on the test set, which means Decision Tree was overfitting the data. Then, if we compared the F1 scores between KNN Classifier and SVM Classifier, SVM Classifier got higher F1 score on both training dataset and test dataset. So from the performance perspective, SVM Classifier is the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we look at the computational costs. Once the classifier is trained, Decision Tree Classifier is very fast on  predicting the result. KNN is fast on training since it only stores the data, but it is slow on prediction. SVM takes longest time on training classifier, but it is faster on prediction compared to KNN. Since we only train the data one time, and may do the prediction a lot every time when there is new data need to be analyzed, we need to put more weights on prediction time. So from the computational costs perspective, Decision Treen Classifier is the best, SVM is the second.\n",
